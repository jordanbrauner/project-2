# About The Food Life

The Food Life is a full-stack application built with Ruby on Rails that allows you to browse, create, and share your favorite recipes. It was my second project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive and developed over the course of a week in November 2015.

# On the backlog:

Features not currently functioning: Boxes, Favorites. The layout is also not fully optimized for responsiveness.
