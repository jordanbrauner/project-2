# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Solid job with your planning documents and README. In the future would like to see more information in your README (e.g., installation instructions, technologies used). This will become especially useful as your projects become more complex and require introduction to new users.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Great job applying what you learned in Unit 2. Good next step would be to implement that many-to-many relationship between boxes and recipes. Otherwise, great job. And as always, love the styling. Makes your application a pleasure to look through!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**.

Great job here. It was very easy to look through your code, and the comments in your views made it clear which chunk of code did what. Encourage you think about how you could separate some of your longer views into partials. Will go a long way in making your code more readable. Also, don't forget to take a look at my inline code comments via the link below.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Great job with this assignment - you have a good grasp on everything we covered in Unit 2. Again, encourage you to implement that many-to-many relationship I mentioned earlier. Let me know if you have any additional questions on how to take this application to the next level - happy to answer them.
